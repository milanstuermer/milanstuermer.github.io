Together with Erich Hörl, Michel Schreiber and Roberto Nigro, we organised a conference dedicated to outlining the contours of the current capital-form. Invited speakers included, amongst others, Leopoldina Fortunati (Udine), Will Davies (Goldsmiths), Anselm Jappe (Rome), Alessandra Mezzadri (SOAS), and Andrea Fumagalli (Pavia). As part of the conference, we organised a screening of <i>Oeconomia</i> followed by a director's Q&A with Carmen Losmann.
