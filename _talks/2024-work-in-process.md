From 2023 to 2025, together with Lennart Posch and Daniel Bella, I co-organized a regular seminar series for the <i>European Society for Process Thought<\i>. This series featured invited researchers discussing their work-in-progress and was meant as a hybrid between a seminar and a community event for all those working in process thought.
