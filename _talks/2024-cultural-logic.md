Together with Mathias Denecke and Holger Kuhn we organised a four-day conference on the concepts of liquidity, flow, and circulation in art and politics with keynotes from Annie McClanahan (UC Irvine), Esther Leslie (Birkbeck), Yvonne Volkart (FHNW Basel), and a film-screening with director's Q&A by Ursula Biemann.
