I am a philosopher of technology working and living in Rotterdam. I am currently doing postdoctoral research on the political epistemology and political economy of AI systems at the Erasmus School of Philosophy where I also coordinate the activities at the newly established [Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and Technology](https://www.eur.nl/en/esphil/erasmus-institute-philosophy-and-technology). We are running a whole range of events throughout the year, both local and online, so do check out our work if you are interested in rethinking the relation between philosophy and technology.

My research is anchored in the tradition of process philosophy, especially in the works of Alfred North Whitehead’s philosophy of organism. My long-term philosophical project aims at developing a Whiteheadian philosophy of technology. 
Most of my published work deals with Whitehead in some way or another, and I am also the Vice-President of the [European Society for Process Thought](http://espt.eu/). So, if you want to talk Whitehead and process, please do get in touch!

Apart from (and intertwined with) my philosophical work, I have a background in film and media studies, and have worked on a variety of film festivals and art projects over the years. I have previously taught film and media theory, developed and taught courses on film criticism, and have been a public speaker at a variety of film events across Europe. 

Over the last fifteen years, I have move around a lot and my academic journey has taken me to Bristol, Lüneburg, Cambridge, and Hamburg, before coming to Rotterdam. 

I am not representing myself on social media platforms anymore. If you want to get in touch, just send me an email!
