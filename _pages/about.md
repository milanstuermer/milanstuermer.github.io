I am a philosopher of technology working and living in Rotterdam. I am currently doing postdoctoral research on the political epistemology and political economy of artificial intelligence systems at the Erasmus School of Philosophy where I also coordinate the activities at the newly established [Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and Technology](https://www.eur.nl/en/esphil/erasmus-institute-philosophy-and-technology). We are running a whole range of events throughout the year, both local and online, so do check out our work if you are interested in rethinking the relation between philosophy and technology.

My research is anchored in the tradition of process philosophy, especially in the works of Alfred North Whitehead’s philosophy of organism. My long-term philosophical project aims at developing a Whiteheadian philosophy of technology. 
Apart from my philosophical work, I have a background in film and media, and have worked on a variety of film festivals and art projects over the years. My academic journey has taken me to Bristol, Lüneburg, Cambridge, and Hamburg, before coming to Rotterdam. 

I am not present on social media platforms anymore. If you want to get in touch, just send me an email!
