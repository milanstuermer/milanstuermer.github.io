I am a philosopher of technology working and living in Rotterdam. I am currently doing postdoctoral research on the political epistemology and political economy of artificial intelligence systems at the Erasmus School of Philosophy where I also coordinate the activities at the newly established [Erasmus Institute for Philosophy and Technology](https://www.eur.nl/en/esphil/erasmus-institute-philosophy-and-technology). 

While my background is in film and media, my current research is anchored in the tradition of process philosophy, especially in the works of Alfred North Whiteheadâ€™s philosophy of organism. 

I am not on any social media platform anymore. If you want to get in touch, just send me an email!

This website is still under construction, so everything else you see is just a placeholder for now.
