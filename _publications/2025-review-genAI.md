excerpt: "The challenge Carrigan's book leaves for all of us is to create broader cultures of scholarship that would be conducive to reflective individual practice, while mitigating the collective harm. This, however, is not a question of a more or less thoughtful use of GenAI systems, but of rethinking and reforming the ways in which we ‘do university’."
