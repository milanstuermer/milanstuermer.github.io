excerpt: "Parole.cc is a website that commissions and publishes new critical texts and media about contemporary culture, in the form of design critique. In this contribution to the compendium on design and finance, I think through the organic critique of finance in design following Lewis Mumford, Thorstein Veblen, and the critique of political economy by Jonathan Nitzan and Shimshon Bichler."
