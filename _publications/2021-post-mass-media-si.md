While the larger framing of this special issue was part of the DFG-research unit Media and Participation, this particular special issue emerged out of discussions around the 2019 European Network for Cinema and Media Studies conference in Gdánsk, Poland. Discussing the usefulness of the designation ‘post-digital times’ with young scholars from all over Europe, we decided to survey how early career researchers adopt and adapt the concept of post-media for their work today, precisely to allow a reframing of the question of participation after the end of the 20th century.
